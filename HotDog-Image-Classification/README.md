This problem's purpose is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as hot dogs or not-hot dogs. This is the same problem as seen in the HBO TV show "Silicon Valley" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY). The dataset used was put together by a user on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog) which contains 498 training images and 500 test images.

My best CNN was able to classify images as a hot dog or not a hot dog with 93% accuracy! My tricks to do this was using the optimal frozen pre-trained network in a transfer learning workflow. There are several large pre-trained models used for image classification that Keras offers, that allow us to get great results without training a single neuron. For this analysis, I compared two different pre-trained networks, MobileNet and Inception Resnet Version 2. Both pre-trained networks were trained using ImageNet, a 14 million image labeled dataset with more than 20,000 classes. Although trained on the same large dataset, both models perform differently when the same transfer learning workflow is run. MobileNet produced an accuracy of around 89% after 5 runs, whereas Inception Resnet Version 2 reached around 92% accuracy.

I also experimented with unfrozen pre-trained networks although that requires much more time and computing power
